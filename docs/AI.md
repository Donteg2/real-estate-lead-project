# 1. Purpose

This document defines how Artificial Intelligence is used within the PrimeHomes Realty Real Estate Lead Bot.

The AI is **not** responsible for:

- Authentication.
- Authorization.
- Database integrity.
- Final business rules.
- Financial transactions.
- Property availability verification.
- Lead ownership.
- User permissions.
- Direct database writes.

The AI provides intelligence; the application provides control.
